### I want data in format other than CSV...
Aim of this project is to provide list of constituents in well know indexes. The project provides all data in CSV format. User can map the CSV data to alternate format. If you are an open source developer and interested in helping us, you can create a project that converts CSV data in other formats. Let us know and we will be happy to provide with the link to your project in our documentation.

### Index I am looking for is not available...
You can add scanner for the index and create a pull request. We will be happy to accept your contribution. However you must follow two guidelines listed below:
1. You must pull data from an official source.
1. Source data must be in well know format(CSV,JSON,...).

### I think data is out of date...
We try our best to keep the data up to date. If you think data is not up to date, then run the scanner and create pull request.
