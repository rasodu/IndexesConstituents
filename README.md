### I want data in format other than CSV...
Aim of this project is to provide list of constituents in well know indexes. The project provides all data in CSV format. User can map the CSV data to alternate format. If you are an open source developer and interested in helping us, you can create a project that converts CSV data in other formats. Let us know and we will be happy to provide with the link to your project in our documentation.
